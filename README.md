# hi guys i'm dawid

I'm a 17 year old CS student from Poland, living in Norway!

My main programming languages are C, C# and Python (I like a little bit of everything though).
Currently I have an internship at NEAS, a local IT and power company in my area.

My passion is programming all kinds of things, from web stores in React, to games using libraries such as Raylib in C.

### My most notable projects so far
| Project | Language |
| --- | --- |
| [NEAS Web Shop - commisioned by my employers](https://github.com/dawc17/neas-nettbutikk) | JavaScript |
| [C++ chat terminal app - most of my C++ knowledge came from building this](https://github.com/dawc17/FelegramchikNative) | C++ |
