# hi guys i'm dawid!

i'm a 17 year old computer science student from poland, living in norway!

my main programming languages are C/C++, C# and Python (i like a little bit of everything though).
currently i have an internship at NEAS, a local IT and power company in my area.

my passion is programming all kinds of things, from web stores in React, to games using libraries such as Raylib in C.
